Besides just using the test cases built into the HackerRank platform you can test this function by piping in data from stdin.

To do run this function on the contents of the file `test_data.txt` run the command `cat test_data.txt | node solution.js`

This reads the file contents and forwards them into the function call that contains our function that reads from stdin.
