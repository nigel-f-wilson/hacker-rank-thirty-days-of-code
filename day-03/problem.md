# Objective

In this challenge, we learn about conditional statements. 

# Task

If _n_ is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If _n_ is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If _n_ is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.
