# Running JavaScript Solution

1. Use Node to run with  `node solution.js`.

JavaScript is not picky about file names and is very simple to run thanks to just-in-time compilation, As such, I have put all JavaScript solutions in single files called solution.js. 

# Running Java Solution

1. Compile with `javac Solution.java` to generate class file.
1. Run class file with `java Solution`.

Note: use the filename with the `.java` extension to compile and without the extension to invoke the generated class file. In most cases the solution is defined in a single class called Solution but in certain exercises designed to teach about classes, inheritance, and other OOO concepts the solution file is named differently. Java is picky about the file name matching the class defined therein.
