# Objective

Today, we are learning about an algorithmic concept called recursion. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

# Recursive Method for Calculating Factorial

$$factorial(N) = N \times factorial(N - 1)$$

# Function Description

Complete the factorial function in the editor below. Be sure to use recursion.

factorial has the following parameter: $n$

* int n: an integer

# Returns

* int: the factorial of $n$

Note: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of 0.

# Input Format

A single integer, $n$ (the argument to pass to factorial).

# Constraints

* $2 \leq n \leq 12$

* Your submission must contain a recursive function named factorial.
