# Objective

Today we're discussing Generics. Not all languages support this construct, so I'll only be solving it in Java and not JavaScript.

# Task

Write a single generic function named `printArray`. This function must take an array of generic elements as a parameter. The locked Solution class in your editor tests your function.

**Note:** You must use generics to solve this challenge. Do not write overloaded functions.


# Input Format

The locked Solution class in your editor will pass different types of arrays to your `printArray` function.

# Constraints

You must have exactly $1$ function named `printArray`.

# Output Format

Your `printArray` function should print each element of its generic array parameter on a new line.
