# Objective

Today we will expand our knowledge of strings, combining it with what we have already learned about loops. 

# Task

Given a string, $S$, of length $N$ that is indexed from $0$ to $N-1$, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line.

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

# Example

$S=adbecf$

Print `abc def`

# Input Format

The first line contains an integer, $T$ (the number of test cases).
Each line $i$ of the $T$ subsequent lines contain a string, $S$.


# Constraints

* $0 \leq T \leq 10$
* $2 \leq$ length of $S \leq 10000$

# Output Format

For each String $S_j$ (where $0 \leq j \leq T - 1$), print $S_j$'s even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by $S_j$'s odd-indexed characters.
